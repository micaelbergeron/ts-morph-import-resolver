# ts-morph-import-resolver
A ts-morph transformer to resolve all imports according to an root alias

## How to run
Make sure your working directory is clean prior to using the `--save` flag, as it will edit all the source files _in-place_.

```bash
ts-node transformer.ts [--save] [--debug] BASE_DIR
```
